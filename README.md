# Game Project – p5.js Practice

This is a simple game project I built to practice using **p5.js**. It's a platform-style game designed to experiment with basic game mechanics, asset handling, and interactivity in JavaScript.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **A / D** – Move left/right  
- **W** or **Spacebar** – Jump  
- **S** – (Optional) Downward movement or crouch, depending on implementation  
- **Collect coins** to increase your score  
- You start with **3 lives** – lose one on collision with enemies or falling off the map  
- The game ends when your lives reach zero

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- Using **p5.js** for rendering and game loop control  
- Working with **sound effects** using `p5.sound`  
- Collision detection  
- Score tracking and UI elements  
- Organizing a basic game architecture in JavaScript

## 📦 Assets

Sound files and other assets are stored in the `/assets` folder. All assets are either royalty-free or used for educational purposes.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add a main menu and restart option  
- More enemies or challenges  
- Power-ups and checkpoints  
- Mobile controls support
